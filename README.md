# Power Learn Project - JavaScript Fundamentals Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts including **variables, conditionals, functions, loops**, and **DOM manipulation**. The goal is to make a static HTML page interactive and practice writing clean, reusable code.

## Features

### Part 1: Variables & Conditionals
- Captures user input (age) and displays messages based on conditions.  
- Uses `if/else` statements to process logic.

### Part 2: Functions
- Includes **custom reusable functions**:
  - `add(a, b)` – calculates the sum of two numbers.
  - `toggleBackground()` – changes the background color of the page.  
- Demonstrates the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself) for cleaner code.

### Part 3: Loops
- **For loop**: generates a list of numbers from 1 to 10 dynamically.  
- **While loop**: counts down from 5 and displays a message.  
- Shows how repetition can simplify tasks and dynamically update content.

### Part 4: DOM Manipulation
- Adds new items to a list dynamically.  
- Updates page content in response to user actions.  
- Demonstr
creating, selecting, and appending elements in the DOM.

## File Structure
- `index.html` – structured HTML page with interactive sections.  
- `script.js` – JavaScript file containing all logic for variables, functions, loops, and DOM interactions.  
- `style.css` (optional) – simple CSS for styling the page and buttons.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.  
2. Interact with each section:  
   - Enter age and check results.  
   - Add numbers and toggle background color.  
   - Generate lists and countdown.  
   - Add new items to the dynamic list.  
3. Inspect the JavaScript file to understand functions, loops, and DOM methods.
